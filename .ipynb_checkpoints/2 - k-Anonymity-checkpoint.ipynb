    "\n",
    "$k$-Anonymity is the first formal privacy definition we have seen. The definition of $k$-Anonymity is designed to formalize our intuition that a piece of auxiliary information should not narrow down the set of possible records for an individual \"too much.\" Stated another way, $k$-Anonymity is designed to ensure that each individual can \"blend into the crowd.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, we say that that a dataset is \"$k$-Anonyized\" for a particular $k$ if each individual in the dataset is a member of a group of size at least $k$, such that each member of the group shares the same *quasi-identifiers* (a selected subset of all the dataset's columns) with all other members of the group. Thus, the individuals in each group \"blend into\" their group - it's possible to narrow down an individual to membership in a particular group, but not to determine which group member is the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, we say that a dataset $D$ satisfies $k$-Anonymity for a value of $k$ if:\n",

    "The process of modifying a dataset so that it satisfies $k$-Anonymity for a desired $k$ is generally accomplished by *generalizing* the data - modifying values to be less specific, and therefore more likely to match the values of other individuals in the dataset. For example, an age which is accurate to a year may be generalized by rounding to the nearest 10 years, or a ZIP code might have its rightmost digits replaced by zeros. For numeric values, this is easy to implement. We'll use the `apply` method of dataframes, and pass in a dictionary named `depths` which specifies how many digits to replace by zeros for each column. This gives us the flexibility to experiment with different levels of generalization for different columns."
